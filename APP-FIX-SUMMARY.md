# Application Fixed - "Failed to Fetch" Error Resolved

## What Was Wrong

The HTML file was trying to connect to the Flask backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, but:
1. The Flask server wasn't serving the HTML file
2. You were opening the HTML as a `file://` URL instead of through the server

## What I Fixed

1. ✅ Updated Flask app to serve the HTML file at the root URL
2. ✅ Fixed database path to work locally (not just in Docker)
3. ✅ Created a simple `start.sh` script that does everything
4. ✅ Added better error handling

## How to Use Now

### Simple 2-Step Process:

**Step 1: Start the server**

    cd retirement-planning-system
    ./start.sh

**Step 2: Open browser**

Go to: **http://127.0.0.1:8080**

**That's it!**

## What You'll See

When you run `./start.sh`, you'll see:

```

===================================================

  Access the application at:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080

  Press Ctrl+C to stop

```

## Key Differences

**OLD WAY (didn't work):**
- Open `index.html` as a file
- Try to connect to server separately
- CORS errors, fetch failures

**NEW WAY (works):**
- Run `./start.sh`
- Open `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- Everything works

## Quick Start Checklist

- [ ] `cd retirement-planning-system`
- [ ] `chmod +x start.sh` (first time only)
- [ ] `./start.sh`
- [ ] Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:8080
- [ ] Click "Run Complete Analysis"

## Files You Can Delete

These are now obsolete:
- ~~run.sh~~ (replaced by start.sh)
- ~~run-simple.sh~~ (replaced by start.sh)
- ~~setup-tunnel.sh~~ (use manage.sh tunnel instead)

## New Files Added

1. **start.sh** - Simple one-command startup
2. **START-HERE.md** - Quick getting started guide
3. **TROUBLESHOOTING.md** - Error solutions
4. **APP-FIX-SUMMARY.md** - This file

## Alternative Commands

If `./start.sh` doesn't work:

    cd retirement-planning-system
    ./manage.sh start

Or manually:

    cd retirement-planning-system/webapp
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install flask flask-cors sqlalchemy numpy pandas
    python app.py

Then open: http://127.0.0.1:8080

## Stopping the Server

Press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal where it's running.

## Common Issues

**"Permission denied"**

    chmod +x start.sh

**"python3: command not found"**

Install Python 3 first

**"Port 8080 already in use"**

Something else is using that port. Either:
- Stop that application
- Or edit `webapp/app.py` line 336 to use port 8081

**Still getting "Failed to fetch"**

Make sure you're accessing **http://127.0.0.1:8080** not `file://...`

## Next Steps

1. **Start the app:** `./start.sh`
2. **Read your analysis:** Open CORRECTED-ANALYSIS.md
3. **Make decisions:** Review spending options
4. **Take action:** Schedule estate attorney
