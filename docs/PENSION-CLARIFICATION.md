# Understanding Your Pension Inputs

The Retirement Planning System is built for flexibility. While we have clarified that your primary pension is **$120,000 / year total**, you can adjust this value at any time to explore "What If" scenarios.

## Where to Change Values

### Annual Pension
To change your yearly pension income:
1. Open the **Profile & Data** tab.
2. Scroll to **Income Streams & Pensions**.
3. Edit the existing "Employer Pension" entry.
4. Adjust the **Amount**, **Start Date**, or **Survivor %**.

### Lump Sum Pension
To see the impact of a one-time payout instead of annual income:
1. Delete the "Employer Pension" from **Income Streams**.
2. Go to the **Assets & Investments** table.
3. Add a new row:
   - **Name**: Pension Lump Sum
   - **Account Type**: Pension (Lump Sum)
   - **Value**: [Enter your payout amount]

## Leveraging the AI Advisor 🤖

The system relies on the **AI Advisor** to help you interpret these changes:

*   **Prompt Recommendation**: Ask the AI, *"Does my plan work better if my pension is $100k with inflation adjustment or $130k without it?"*
*   **Actionable Advice**: The AI can generate a list of "next steps" if you decide to change your pension structure.
*   **Smart Integration**: Use the **"⚡ Quick Apply"** or **"✅ Convert to Action Items"** buttons to turn AI pension advice into part of your official plan.

## Strategic Baseline

- **Current Input**: $120,000 / year (Combined).
- **Target Spending**: $300,000 / year.
- **Role of Pension**: Covers 40% of target spending, significantly reducing the pressure on your investable assets.

**Recommendation**: Keep the pension as **Annual Income** to maximize your Monte Carlo success rate (~97%), as it provides a guaranteed floor that survives market downturns.
