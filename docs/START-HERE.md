## What's New in Version 3.9

### Smart Recommendations
The system connects directly to Gemini and Claude. Click the **"AI Recommendations"** button to get a prioritized list of strategic moves tailored to your specific balances and income.

### Quick Apply

### Scenario Sandbox
On the **Dashboard**, use the sliders to test "What If" scenarios in real-time. See how reducing spending by $10k/year or working 2 years longer impacts your 30-year projection.

### Flexible Income Streams
Pensions are no longer static hardcoded values. You can model them as:
- **Annual Income**: Standard pension payments with COLA (inflation) options.
- **Lump Sum**: Large one-time payouts that roll into your Traditional IRA.
