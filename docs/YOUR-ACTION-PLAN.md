## Phase 4: Retirement Years (2027-2037)

### Roth Conversion Window

**Years 2027-2037** (Age 62-72 for you, 54-64 for Mindy)

**Annual Routine:**
1. **November**: Project income for year
2. **December**: Execute Roth conversion
3. **January**: Pay estimated taxes
4. **April**: File return, adjust estimates

**Example Year (2028)**:
- Pension: $120,000
- Work income: $0 (both retired)
- IRA withdrawal: $20,000 (need spending money)
- Total income: $140,000
- Standard deduction: $32,300 (65+ bonus)
- Taxable before conversion: $107,700
- Top of 22% bracket: $201,050
- Room in 22% bracket: ~$93,000
- **Conversion amount**: $35,000 (fill 12%) or $93,000 (fill 22%)
- Tax cost (12%): $4,200 OR
- Tax cost (22%): $20,460

**Strategy Decision**: 
- Years 1-5: Fill 12% bracket (~$35k/year)
- Years 6-10: Consider 22% bracket if estate large

### Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

**First RMD**: Age 73 (2038 for you)

**At age 73 with $2.8M IRA**:
- RMD factor: 26.5
- Required withdrawal: $105,660/year
- Tax at 24%: ~$25,000

**If you convert $300k before RMDs**:
- Remaining IRA: $2.5M
- RMD at 73: $94,340
- Tax savings: ~$2,700/year
- Plus: $300k grows tax-free in Roth

### Withdrawal Strategy

**Age 62-70** (Before Social Security):
- Pension: $120,000
- Need: $300,000
- Gap: $180,000
- Source: Portfolio (taxable first, then IRA)
- Strategy: Harvest gains in 0% bracket

**Age 70-73** (After SS, Before RMDs):
- Pension: $120,000
- Social Security: $104,000 (delayed to 70: $4,588 + $4,092 = $8,680/mo)
- Total guaranteed: $224,000
- Need: $300,000
- Gap: $76,000
- Source: Portfolio withdrawals + Roth conversions

**Age 73+** (RMDs Required):
- Pension: $120,000
- Social Security: $104,000
- RMD: ~$95,000 (from remaining IRA)
- Total: $319,000
- Exceeds need by $19,000
- Strategy: Donate excess via QCD to charity

---

## Phase 5: Advanced Planning (Age 70+)

### Qualified Charitable Distributions

**Starting age 70.5** (Available 2035):
- Donate up to $105,000/year from IRA to charity
- Counts toward RMD
- Not included in income (better than deduction)
- Avoids SS taxation and IRMAA
- **If charitable**: Use this instead of RMD

### Medicare & IRMAA Planning

**Medicare starts**: Age 65 (2030 for you, 2038 for Mindy)

**IRMAA Thresholds (2024)**:
- <$206,000 income: No surcharge
- $206,000-258,000: +$839/year per person
- $258,000-322,000: +$2,096/year per person

**Strategy**:
- Watch income 2 years before Medicare
- Age 63 (2028): Keep MAGI <$206k for 2030
- Avoid large Roth conversions in year 63-64
- RMDs may push over threshold (use QCD)

### Estate Tax Planning

**Current exemption**: $13.61M per person (2024)
**Scheduled reduction**: ~$7M in 2026

**Your situation**:
- Net worth: $3.4M
- Plus growth over 30 years: ~$8M
- Still under exemption
- **Action needed**: None for federal estate tax

**State estate tax**: 
- Check your state's threshold
- Some states as low as $1M
- Consider relocation to no-estate-tax state
