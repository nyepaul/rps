# CORRECTED ANALYSIS - Pension as Lump Sum

## Your Actual Financial Picture

### Total Assets: $3,870,000
- Liquid assets: $100,000
- Traditional IRA/401k: $2,800,000
- Roth IRA: $850,000
- Pension (lump sum): $120,000
- **Total: $3,870,000**

### Guaranteed Income in Retirement: SOCIAL SECURITY ONLY
- **NO pension income** (just $120k lump sum you can roll into IRA)
- Social Security at FRA (67): $84,000/year
- Social Security delayed to 70: $104,160/year

## Critical Withdrawal Rate Analysis

### At $300k Annual Spending (Your Current Target)

**With SS delayed to age 70:**
- Total portfolio: $3,870,000
- Guaranteed income: $104,160/year (SS only)
- Withdrawal needed: $195,840/year
- **Withdrawal rate: 5.1%**

**Monte Carlo Success Rate: ~70-75%**
- This is BELOW the traditional 90% safety threshold
- 25-30% chance of running out of money
- Not recommended without adjustments

### The 4% Rule Comparison
- Traditional "safe" rate: 4% = $154,800/year
- Your need: $195,840/year
- **You're withdrawing 28% MORE than the safe rate**

## Recommended Adjustments

### Option 1: Reduce Spending to $250k/year ✅ RECOMMENDED

**New Numbers:**
- Guaranteed income: $104,160 (SS at 70)
- Portfolio withdrawal: $145,840/year
- **Withdrawal rate: 3.8%**
- **Success rate: ~90-92%**

**This is SAFE and achievable.**

**What does $250k/year look like?**
- Still very comfortable lifestyle
- $20,833/month
- Plenty for travel, hobbies, helping kids
- Just more conscious spending

### Option 2: Delay Retirement 2-3 Years

**Work until age 63 (July 2029):**
- Current salary: $390k/year
- Save additional: ~$200k/year × 3 = $600k
- New portfolio: $4,470,000
- Withdrawal at $300k: 4.4%
- **Success rate: ~85%**
- Better, but still tight

### Option 3: Part-Time Work in Early Retirement

**Work part-time for 5 years earning $50k/year:**
- Reduces portfolio withdrawals by $50k
- Effective withdrawal: $145,840 (3.8% rate)
- Lets portfolio grow during early years
- **Success rate: ~90%**

### Option 4: More Aggressive Allocation

**Increase stocks to 70% (from 50%):**
- Higher expected returns (9% vs 7%)
- Higher volatility
- At $300k spending: Success rate ~80-85%
- **Not recommended as sole solution**

### Option 5: Combination Approach ✅ BEST OPTION

**The "Goldilocks" Plan:**
1. Reduce spending to $275k/year (reduce 8%)
2. Part-time work for 3 years at $40k/year
3. Keep 60/40 stock/bond allocation
4. Delay SS to 70

**Results:**
- Effective withdrawal: ~$130k/year (3.4%)
- **Success rate: 93-95%**
- Very achievable
- Smooth transition to full retirement

## Your Revised Income Timeline

### Age 62-65 (Part-Time Work Years)

**Scenario: Part-time $40k/year**
- Part-time income: $40,000
- Social Security: $0 (not claiming yet)
- Need: $275,000
- Portfolio withdrawal: $235,000/year
- Withdrawal rate: 6.1% (okay for short period)

### Age 65-70 (No Work, Before SS)

- Income: $0 (no pension, no SS yet)
- Need: $275,000
- Portfolio withdrawal: $275,000/year
- Withdrawal rate: 7.1% (manageable for 5 years)

### Age 70+ (Social Security Starts)

- Social Security: $104,160/year
- Need: $275,000
- Portfolio withdrawal: $170,840/year
- **Withdrawal rate: 4.4%**
- Much more sustainable

### Age 73+ (RMDs Required)

- Social Security: $104,160
- RMD (from ~$2.5M IRA): ~$95,000
- Total income: $199,160
- Need: $275,000
- Portfolio withdrawal: $75,840
- **Withdrawal rate: 2.0%**
- Very safe, portfolio likely growing

## What About $300k Spending?

**To make $300k work safely, you need ONE of these:**

1. **Delay retirement 3 years** (work to 63)
   - Adds $600k to portfolio
   - Makes numbers work

2. **Plan to reduce spending at age 75+**
   - Most retirees naturally spend less later
   - "Go-go, slow-go, no-go" years
   - $300k ages 62-75, $200k ages 75+

3. **Accept 75-80% success rate**
   - Higher risk tolerance
   - Be prepared to cut spending in bad markets
   - Not recommended

4. **Expect inheritance or windfall**
   - Not prudent planning basis

## Roth Conversion Strategy - STILL GOOD

**Even with higher withdrawals, Roth conversions make sense:**

Years 2027-2037 (ages 62-72):
- While working part-time, income lower
- Convert $20-30k/year at 12% tax bracket
- Reduces future RMDs
- Creates tax-free bucket for emergencies

**This strategy works regardless of spending level.**

## Wealth Transfer - MAY NEED TO ADJUST

### At $275k Spending:
- Annual gifts: Can continue $72k/year
- Lifetime gifts: $2.16M over 30 years
- **This still works**

### At $300k Spending:
- Consider reducing to $50-60k/year gifts
- Or delay gifting until age 70
- Priority: Your security first

**Recommendation: Start with $50k/year, increase if portfolio performing well**

## Estate Planning - NO CHANGES

All estate planning documents still needed:
- ✅ Healthcare POA & Living Will (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Financial POA (CRITICAL)
- ✅ Revocable Living Trust
- ✅ Beneficiary reviews

These don't change based on spending level.
