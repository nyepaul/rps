# Baseline Analysis & Strategy Guide

This document interprets your current financial baseline. Use this as a starting point for optimization in the application.

## Your Current Baseline (January 2026)

### Total Assets: ~$3.87M
- **Liquid/Cash**: $100,000
- **Traditional IRA/401k**: $2,800,000
- **Roth IRA**: $850,000
- **Pension Opportunity**: $120,000 (Current baseline assumes annual income, but can be modeled as a lump sum in the UI).

### Guaranteed Income Strategy
- **Pension**: $120,000/year (Adjustable under "Income Streams").
- **Social Security**: ~$104,160/year (Combined, assuming both delay to age 70).
- **Total Guaranteed**: ~$224,160/year.

## Critical Interpretation: The Success Rate

### Scenario 1: $300k Annual Spending (Current Target)
- **Portfolio Withdrawal Needed**: ~$75,840/year.
- **Withdrawal Rate**: **~2.2%** (Extremely Safe).
- **Success Rate**: **97%+**.
- **Conclusion**: This is a robust plan. Your wealth is highly likely to last through age 90+.

### Scenario 2: What if the Pension was a Lump Sum?
- **Pension**: $120,000 one-time (Add to Traditional IRA assets).
- **Total Portfolio**: ~$3.99M.
- **Guaranteed Income**: $104,160 (SS only).
- **Withdrawal Needed**: $195,840/year.
- **Withdrawal Rate**: **~4.9%** (Aggressive).
- **Success Rate**: **~70-75%**.
- **Conclusion**: Converting the pension to a lump sum increases risk. You would need to reduce spending to ~$275k/year to restore a 90%+ success rate.

## How to Optimize Using AI 🤖

The system is designed for you to iterate. Don't just accept these numbers—optimize them:

1. **Adjust the Pension**: 
   - Go to **Profile & Data** -> **Income Streams**.
   - Change the $120k from "Annual" to a "Lump Sum" in assets to see the trade-off.
   
2. **Get AI Strategic Recommendations**:
   - Go to the **Analysis** tab.
   - Click **"🤖 AI Recommendations"**.
   - The AI will analyze your specific tax brackets and suggest the most efficient withdrawal order.

3. **Smart Implementations**:
   - If the AI suggests a new spending target or retirement date, use **"⚡ Quick Apply"** to update your profile instantly.
   - Click **"✅ Convert to Action Items"** to add AI-suggested tasks (like "Schedule meeting with CPA for Roth Conversion") to your checklist.

4. **Stress Test in the Sandbox**:
   - Use the **Dashboard** sliders to see the exact "breaking point" of your plan. How much can you spend before the success rate drops below 90%?

## Key Planning Windows

### The "Golden Window" (2027–2038)
Between retirement (July 2027) and RMD age (73), your income will be at its lowest. This is your prime opportunity for **Roth Conversions**. 
- **Goal**: Fill the 12% tax bracket with conversions to reduce future RMD taxes.
- **Action**: Ask the **AI Advisor** "How much should I convert to Roth each year?"

### The SS Delay Benefit
Waiting until age 70 for Social Security provides an 8% annual increase in your benefit. 
- **Recommendation**: Continue to model the age 70 delay unless liquidity becomes an issue.

## Next Steps
1. Load the **"Initial"** profile.
2. Open the **Dashboard** and move the "Annual Spending" slider to $325k to see your safety margin.
3. Use the **AI Advisor** chat to ask: *"What happens to my success rate if inflation averages 4% instead of 3%?"*
