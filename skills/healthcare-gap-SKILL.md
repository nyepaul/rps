# Healthcare Gap & Medicare Transition Skill

## Purpose
To bridge the critical health insurance coverage gap between early retirement and Medicare eligibility (Age 65), and to optimize Medicare choices thereafter.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Bridging the Gap (Pre-65)
**Affordable Care Act (ACA / Marketplace):**
- **Subsidies (PTC):** Based on Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI).
- **The "Cliff":** Previously, subsidies ended abruptly at 400% poverty level. (Check current "subsidy cliff" rules).
- **Strategy:** Manage MAGI (via Roth withdrawals or cash savings) to qualify for subsidies.

**COBRA:**
- Continues employer coverage for 18 months.
- **Pros:** Seamless network continuity.
- **Cons:** Very expensive (You pay 102% of premium).

**Short-Term Health Insurance:**
- **Pros:** Cheaper.
- **Cons:** Does not cover pre-existing conditions; not ACA compliant.

### 2. Medicare Basics (Post-65)
**Part A:** Hospital (Free if you worked 40 quarters).
**Part B:** Medical (Standard premium + IRMAA).
**Part D:** Prescription Drugs.

### 3. The "Medigap" vs. "Advantage" Decision
**Option 1: Original Medicare + Medigap (Supplement) + Part D**
- **Pros:** See any doctor accepting Medicare; predictable costs; standardized plans (G, N).
- **Cons:** Higher monthly premiums.

**Option 2: Medicare Advantage (Part C)**
- **Pros:** Lower premiums (often $0); often includes dental/vision.
- **Cons:** Network restrictions (HMO/PPO); prior authorization requirements; higher out-of-pocket max.

### 4. IRMAA Planning (Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount)
- Medicare premiums increase significantly if income exceeds thresholds (e.g., ~$206k for couples).
- **Lookback Rule:** Premiums are based on tax returns from *2 years prior*.
- **Strategy:** Roth conversions at age 63+ can spike IRMAA premiums at 65+. Plan accordingly.

## Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Estimate MAGI for the "gap" years (retirement to age 65).
- [ ] Compare ACA plan costs vs. COBRA.
- [ ] Model the impact of Roth conversions on future IRMAA brackets.
- [ ] Verify if spouse's employer plan can cover the gap.
- [ ] Select Medigap vs. Advantage based on travel and health needs.

## Common Pitfalls
- Missing the Initial Enrollment Period (Part B penalty is permanent).
- Assuming Medicare is free (it's not).
- Ignoring the 2-year lookback for IRMAA.
- Choosing Advantage plans without checking network for specialists.
