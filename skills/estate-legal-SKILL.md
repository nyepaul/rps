# Estate & Legal Planning Skill

## Purpose
Comprehensive estate planning framework covering essential documents, trust structures, beneficiary planning, probate avoidance, and wealth transfer strategies.

## Core Framework

### 1. Essential Estate Documents

**Last Will and Testament**
- Names executor
- Distributes probate assets
- Guardianship for minor children
- Specific bequests
- Residuary clause (everything else)
- **Update every 3-5 years or after major life events**

**Revocable Living Trust (RLT)**
- Avoids probate (faster, private, lower cost)
- Maintains control during life
- Seamless transition at death
- Protects privacy (not public record)
- No tax benefits vs. will
- Can manage assets if incapacitated
- **Recommended for estates >$500k or multiple states**

**Pour-Over Will**
- Companion to trust
- Catches assets not in trust
- Names executor and guardians
- Transfers forgotten assets to trust

**Durable Power of Attorney (POA)**
- Financial decisions if incapacitated
- Immediate or springing (upon incapacity)
- Choose trustworthy agent
- Specify powers (broad vs. limited)
- **Critical - without this, court appoints conservator**

**Healthcare Power of Attorney**
- Medical decisions if incapacitated
- HIPAA authorization
- Choose someone who knows your wishes
- Different from financial POA
- **Must have - hospitals require this**

**Living Will / Advance Directive**
- End-of-life treatment preferences
- Life support decisions
- DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) orders
- Organ donation
- **Discuss with family before crisis**

**HIPAA Authorization**
- Allows disclosure of medical info
- Often combined with healthcare POA
- Name multiple people if desired

### 2. Trust Structures

**Revocable Living Trust (RLT)**
- Grantor = Trustee during life
- Successor trustee at death/incapacity
- Retains control and flexibility
- No income tax benefits
- Estate tax inclusion
- **Best for: Probate avoidance, privacy, incapacity planning**

**Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT)**
- Owns life insurance policy
- Removes proceeds from estate
- Beneficiaries receive tax-free
- Cannot be changed once created
- Requires Crummey letters for contributions
- **Best for: Estates >$13M, life insurance >$1M**

**Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT)**
- Transfer home to trust, retain use
- Gift tax discount (retained interest)
- Removes future appreciation from estate
- Must outlive trust term
- **Best for: High-value homes, estate tax concerns**

**Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)**
- Transfer assets, receive annuity
- Appreciation passes tax-free to heirs
- Low/zero gift tax if structured right
- Risk: must outlive term
- **Best for: Appreciating assets, business interests**

**Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT)**
- Income for life, remainder to charity
- Tax deduction for charitable portion
- Defer capital gains on appreciated assets
- Cannot be changed once funded
- **Best for: Charitable intent, appreciated assets**

**Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT)**
- Irrevocable trust for spouse
- Removes assets from estate
- Spouse can access if needed
- Reciprocal trust doctrine risk
- **Best for: Using lifetime exemption, estate tax planning**

**Special Needs Trust (SNT)**
- Provides for disabled beneficiary
- Preserves government benefits
- Professional trustee recommended
- Strict rules on distributions
- **Best for: Beneficiary on SSI/Medicaid**

### 3. Beneficiary Designation Strategy

**Hierarchy of Asset Transfer:**
1. Beneficiary designation (supersedes everything)
2. Trust provisions (if asset titled to trust)
3. Joint ownership (right of survivorship)
4. Will provisions (probate assets only)

**IRA/401(k) Beneficiaries:**
- **Primary: Spouse** (can roll over, defer taxes)
- **Contingent: Children or Trust** (10-year rule post-SECURE Act)
- Avoid naming estate (immediate taxation)
- Consider trust for minor children
- Charity as beneficiary (no income tax on distribution)

**Roth IRA Beneficiaries:**
- **Best for heirs** (tax-free growth continues)
- Stretch distributions over 10 years
- Consider younger beneficiaries (more growth)
- Grandchildren for generational wealth

**Life Insurance Beneficiaries:**
- **Spouse or ILIT** (estate tax exclusion)
- Per stirpes (children share if one predeceases)
- Avoid minor children directly (court conservatorship)
- Update after divorce, remarriage, births

**TOD/POD Accounts:**
- Transfer on Death (brokerage)
- Payable on Death (bank accounts)
- Avoid probate
- Simple and free
- Update regularly

### 4. Probate Avoidance Strategies

**What Goes Through Probate:**
- Assets titled in deceased's name alone
- No beneficiary designation
- No joint ownership
- No trust ownership

**Probate Costs:**
- 3-7% of estate value (attorney, executor fees)
- 6-18 months timeline
- Public record (privacy loss)
- Delays to heirs

**Avoidance Techniques:**
1. Revocable Living Trust (primary method)
2. Joint ownership with right of survivorship
3. Beneficiary designations (IRA, life insurance)
4. TOD/POD on accounts
5. Small estate affidavit (if <$50k-$150k depending on state)

### 5. Marital Deduction and Portability

**Unlimited Marital Deduction:**
- Unlimited transfers to spouse (gift/estate tax-free)
- Defers estate tax until second death
- Must be US citizen spouse
- Bypass trust alternative (credit shelter trust)

**Portability Election:**
- Deceased spouse's unused exemption transfers to survivor
- Must elect on estate tax return (Form 706)
- File even if estate <$13.61M
- **9-month deadline from death**
- Expires if survivor remarries and new spouse dies

**Credit Shelter Trust (Bypass Trust):**
- Uses first spouse's exemption
- Grows outside surviving spouse's estate
- Complex administration
- Less important with portability
- Still useful for state estate taxes

### 6. Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax

**Purpose:**
- Prevents wealthy families from skipping generations
- 40% tax on transfers to grandchildren (if >exemption)
- Same exemption as estate tax ($13.61M in 2024)

**Planning Strategies:**
- Direct payments for education/medical (unlimited)
- 529 plans (five-year front-loading)
- Dynasty trusts (multi-generational wealth)
- GST-exempt trusts
- Annual exclusion gifts to grandchildren

### 7. Incapacity Planning

**Financial Incapacity:**
- Durable Power of Attorney (immediate)
- Revocable Living Trust (successor trustee)
- Representative payee (Social Security)
- Joint accounts (limited solution)

**Medical Incapacity:**
- Healthcare Power of Attorney
- Living Will/Advance Directive
- HIPAA authorization
- DNR orders if appropriate

**Cognitive Decline:**
- Pre-plan while competent
- Consider co-trustees or trust protector
- Automatic succession provisions
- Professional fiduciary option
- **Discuss with family openly**

### 8. Business Succession Planning

**Key Issues:**
- Who takes over business?
- Buy-sell agreements
- Valuation methodology
- Funding (life insurance)
- Key person insurance
- Transition timeline

**Entity Structure:**
- LLC (flexibility, asset protection)
- S-Corp (tax benefits if active)
- C-Corp (less common for small business)
- Sole proprietorship (no protection)

**Transfer Strategies:**
- Gift shares annually (valuation discount)
- Sale to IDGT (intentionally defective grantor trust)
- ESOP (employee stock ownership plan)
- Family limited partnership

### 9. Asset Protection

**Exempt Assets (varies by state):**
- Primary residence (homestead)
- Retirement accounts (ERISA-qualified)
- Life insurance cash value
- Tenancy by the entirety (some states)

**Asset Protection Trusts:**
- Domestic (limited states: Nevada, Delaware, SD)
- Offshore (more protection, more complex)
- Irrevocable (lose control)
- Limited creditor access

**Liability Insurance:**
- Umbrella policy ($1M-$5M)
- Professional liability (E&O)
- Directors & Officers (D&O)
- Cheaper than trusts

### 10. State-Specific Considerations

**Community Property States:**
- AZ, CA, ID, LA, NV, NM, TX, WA, WI
- Assets acquired during marriage = 50/50
- Full step-up in basis at first death
- Different beneficiary rules

**Estate Tax States:**
- 12 states + DC have estate tax
- Exemptions as low as $1M (OR, MA)
- Consider relocation in retirement

**Income Tax States:**
- No state income tax: AK, FL, NV, SD, TN, TX, WA, WY
- Retirement relocation strategy
- Check pension/SS taxation rules
