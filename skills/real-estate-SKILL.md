# Real Estate & Lifestyle Skill

## Purpose
To incorporate real estate assets (primary, vacation, investment) into the broader financial plan and align physical living arrangements with retirement lifestyle goals.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. The Primary Residence Decision
**Stay vs. Downsize:**
- **Financial:** Unlock equity for portfolio; reduce maintenance/property tax.
- **Lifestyle:** Proximity to family/medical; single-level living (aging in place).

**Tax Exclusion (Section 121):**
- Exclude up to $500k (married) of capital gains if lived in 2 of last 5 years.

### 2. Investment Real Estate
**Cash Flow vs. Appreciation:**
- Income properties can replace bonds/annuities for income.
- **1031 Exchange:** Defer taxes by swapping one investment property for another.
- **Depreciation Recapture:** The tax bill comes due upon sale (unless 1031 or step-up at death).

### 3. Vacation Homes
**Personal Use vs. Rental:**
- **"Master's Rule" (Augusta Rule):** Rent out for <15 days/year = tax-free income.
- **Mixed Use:** Complex deduction rules if used personally >14 days/year.

### 4. Relocation Strategy
**Tax Arbitrage:**
- Moving from high-tax state to low/no-income-tax state.
- **Domicile Audit Risk:** High-tax states aggressively audit "leavers." Must sever ties (DL, voting, doctors, clubs).

## Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Calculate "Return on Equity" for investment properties.
- [ ] Assess potential capital gains tax on primary residence sale.
- [ ] Evaluate "Aging in Place" feasibility (stairs, maintenance).
- [ ] Compare cost of owning vacation home vs. renting/traveling.
- [ ] Review state tax implications of potential relocation.

## Common Pitfalls
- Underestimating maintenance costs (1-2% of value annually).
- Counting on "downsizing" to fund retirement without running the numbers.
- Becoming "house poor" in retirement (high fixed costs).
- Failing to properly document "change of domicile" for tax purposes.
