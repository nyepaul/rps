# Retirement Planning Skill

## Purpose
Comprehensive retirement planning analysis including cash flow modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, withdrawal strategies, and longevity planning.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Cash Flow Projection Model
**Annual Income Sources:**
- Social Security (inflation-adjusted)
- Pension (check COLA provisions)
- Portfolio withdrawals
- Part-time work (if applicable)
- Rental income
- Annuity payments

**Annual Expenses:**
- Essential living expenses
- Discretionary spending
- Healthcare (increasing ~6% annually)
- Travel and lifestyle
- Taxes (federal, state, local)
- Insurance premiums
- Charitable giving
- One-time major expenses

**Key Calculation:**
```
Annual Surplus/Deficit = Total Income - Total Expenses
Portfolio End Balance = Beginning + Returns + Surplus/Deficit
```

### 2. Withdrawal Strategies

**Fixed Percentage (Bengen 4% Rule)**
- Withdraw 4% of initial portfolio value, adjusted for inflation
- Simple but doesn't adapt to market conditions
- 95% success rate over 30 years historically

**Variable Percentage (Dynamic)**
- Adjust withdrawals based on portfolio performance
- Example: 4-6% range based on portfolio value
- Guards against sequence of returns risk
- More flexible for changing needs

**Guardrails Strategy**
- Set upper/lower bounds (e.g., $80k-$120k)
- Increase spending when portfolio grows
- Decrease when portfolio shrinks
- Balances stability and flexibility

**Floor-and-Ceiling**
- Essential expenses covered by guaranteed income
- Discretionary funded by portfolio
- Adjustable based on performance

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation Framework

**Key Variables:**
- Expected return (stocks/bonds)
- Standard deviation (volatility)
- Correlation between assets
- Inflation rate
- Time horizon
- Withdrawal amount

**Simulation Process:**
1. Run 10,000 scenarios with random returns
2. Calculate success rate (portfolio lasts entire retirement)
3. Identify failure scenarios and causes
4. Test sensitivity to assumptions

**Success Metrics:**
- 90%+ success rate = very safe
- 75-90% = moderate risk
- <75% = adjustments needed

**Key Outputs:**
- Probability of success
- Median ending balance
- Worst-case scenarios (5th percentile)
- Best-case scenarios (95th percentile)
- Years until depletion (failure cases)

### 4. Social Security Optimization

**Claiming Strategies:**
- Early (62): Reduced benefits (~70% of FRA)
- Full Retirement Age (67): 100% of benefit
- Delayed (70): Increased benefits (~124% of FRA)

**Breakeven Analysis:**
- Early vs FRA breakeven: ~age 78
- FRA vs delayed breakeven: ~age 80-82

**Spousal Strategies:**
- Higher earner delays to 70 (maximizes survivor benefit)
- Lower earner may claim earlier
- Survivor receives higher of two benefits

**File and Suspend (no longer available but important to know)**

### 5. Longevity Planning

**Life Expectancy Tables:**
- Male age 60: ~23 years (to 83)
- Female age 52: ~32 years (to 84)
- Joint survival: 50% chance one lives to 92+

**Planning Considerations:**
- Plan to age 90-95 minimum
- Consider long-term care needs (avg 3 years)
- Healthcare costs increase with age
- Cognitive decline planning
- Inflation compounds over 30+ years

### 6. Sequence of Returns Risk

**The Risk:**
- Poor returns early in retirement devastate portfolio
- Same average return, different order = different outcome
- Most dangerous in first 5-10 years

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Bond tent (higher bonds early, reduce over time)
- Cash buffer (2-3 years expenses)
- Flexible spending (reduce in down markets)
- Part-time income early in retirement
- Delay Social Security to reduce withdrawals

### 7. Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Sequencing

**Standard Sequence:**
1. Required Minimum Distributions (must take)
2. Taxable accounts (most flexible)
3. Tax-deferred (Traditional IRA/401k)
4. Tax-free (Roth IRA - save for last/legacy)

**Exceptions:**
- Fill lower tax brackets with traditional IRA withdrawals
- Qualified dividends/cap gains have 0% bracket
- Tax-gain harvesting in low-income years
- Balance to avoid IRMAA surcharges

**Roth Conversion Opportunity:**
- Convert in low-income years (between retirement and RMDs)
- Convert in low-income years (between retirement and SS)
- Pay taxes from taxable account
- Reduces future RMDs
- Tax-free growth for heirs

### 8. Healthcare Planning

**Before Age 65 (Medicare):**
- ACA marketplace subsidies (if income <$70k)
- COBRA (expensive, 18 months max)
- Spouse's employer plan
- HSA distributions (tax-free for medical)

**Age 65+:**
- Medicare Parts A, B, D
- Medigap or Medicare Advantage
- IRMAA surcharges (income >$206k married)

**Long-term Care:**
- Average cost: $100k/year facility
- Average duration: 3 years
- Self-insure vs. insurance (buy at 55-65)
- Hybrid life/LTC policies
- Medicaid planning (spend-down)

### 9. Inflation Protection

**Historical Inflation:**
- Average: ~3% annually
- Recent spike: 8%+ (2022)
- Retirement can span 30+ years
- $100k purchasing power becomes $41k at 3% over 30 years

**Inflation-Protected Assets:**
- TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)
- I-Bonds (limited to $10k/year)
- Real estate (typically appreciates)
- Stocks (grow earnings over time)
- COLA pensions (rare but valuable)
- Social Security (COLA adjustments)

**Spending Adjustments:**
- Early retirement (70s): higher discretionary spending
- Mid retirement (80s): moderate spending
- Late retirement (90s): lower spending, higher healthcare

### 10. Estate and Legacy Planning

**Asset Titling:**
- Joint tenancy (avoids probate, full step-up for survivor)
- TOD/POD (transfer/payable on death)
- Trust ownership (privacy, control)

**Beneficiary Optimization:**
- Traditional IRA: Spouse (can roll over) or Trust
- Roth IRA: Heirs (tax-free growth)
- Life insurance: Trust (estate tax exclusion)
- Check beneficiaries every 2-3 years

**Wealth Transfer Timing:**
- Annual gifts: $18,000/person tax-free (2024)
- Lifetime exemption: $13.61M (2024, reverts to ~$7M in 2026)
- Gift while alive to see impact vs. inheritance
- 529 plans for education
- Pay medical/education directly (unlimited)

## Analysis Checklist

- [ ] Project annual cash flows for 30+ years
- [ ] Run Monte Carlo simulation (10,000 scenarios)
- [ ] Optimize Social Security claiming strategy
- [ ] Calculate safe withdrawal rate
- [ ] Model Roth conversion opportunities
- [ ] Assess healthcare coverage and costs
- [ ] Evaluate long-term care risk
- [ ] Review asset allocation appropriateness
- [ ] Check tax-efficiency of withdrawals
- [ ] Verify beneficiary designations
- [ ] Document assumptions and update annually

## Key Questions to Ask Client

1. What's your expected retirement date(s)?
2. What annual spending do you need/want?
3. Do you have guaranteed income sources (pension, SS)?
4. What's your risk tolerance during retirement?
5. Do you want to leave money to heirs or spend it down?
6. Any major one-time expenses planned?
7. Will you relocate (state taxes matter)?
8. Any part-time work planned in retirement?
9. Healthcare coverage plan before Medicare?
10. Long-term care insurance or self-insure?

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Underestimating longevity (plan to 90+)
- Ignoring healthcare cost inflation
- Taking Social Security too early
- Not planning for sequence of returns risk
- Forgetting taxes in withdrawal planning
- Not updating plan annually
- Over-optimistic return assumptions
- Ignoring required minimum distributions
- Not considering widow/widower scenario
