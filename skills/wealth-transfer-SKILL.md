# Wealth Transfer & Gifting Strategy Skill

## Purpose
Strategic framework for tax-efficient wealth transfer to children and grandchildren including annual gifting, education funding, trust strategies, and timing optimization.

## Core Framework

### 1. Annual Exclusion Gifting

**2024 Limits:**
- $18,000 per person per year
- No limit on number of recipients
- $36,000 from married couple (gift splitting)
- Inflation-adjusted annually

**Strategic Use:**
```
Family of 4 (parents + 2 sons):
Parent 1 → Son 1: $18,000
Parent 1 → Son 2: $18,000
Parent 2 → Son 1: $18,000
Parent 2 → Son 2: $18,000
Total annual: $72,000 tax-free
Over 10 years: $720,000 removed from estate
```

**Advantages:**
- No gift tax return required
- Reduces estate
- Removes future appreciation from estate
- Can start immediately
- Heirs get your cost basis

**Best Assets to Gift:**
- Cash (simplest)
- Appreciated stock (if heir in lower bracket)
- Business interests (with valuation discount)
- Life insurance policies (remove from estate)

**Timing:**
- January 1st (full year of growth for heir)
- Or December 31st (last chance for year)
- Don't miss a year (can't catch up)

### 2. Education Funding Strategies

**529 Plans:**
- Tax-free growth for education
- State tax deduction (some states)
- Front-load: 5 years at once ($90,000/person = $180k from couple)
- Must file Form 709 if front-loading
- Can change beneficiaries
- Leftover can go to grandchildren
- New: Up to $35k can transfer to beneficiary's Roth IRA

**Coverdell ESA:**
- $2,000/year limit per child
- Income limits apply
- More investment flexibility
- Can use for K-12 (not just college)

**UTMA/UGMA Accounts:**
- Custodial accounts (irrevocable gift)
- Child takes control at 18-21
- Kiddie tax rules apply
- No tax benefit for contributions
- More flexibility than 529 (any use)

**Direct Tuition Payments:**
- Unlimited amount
- Must pay directly to institution
- Doesn't count against $18,000 annual exclusion
- Best for wealthy grandparents
- Medical expenses also qualify

**Strategy Comparison:**
```
Grandson's college in 10 years, need $200k:

Option 1 - 529 Front-load:
- $90k from each grandparent now ($180k total)
- Grows tax-free
- Leftover for grad school or siblings

Option 2 - Annual Gifts:
- $18k/year × 10 years × 2 grandparents = $360k
- Grandson invests (taxable)
- Flexibility for non-education

Option 3 - Direct Payment:
- Wait until college
- Pay tuition directly
- Still gift $18k/year for other expenses
- Maximum estate reduction
```

### 3. Lifetime Exemption Strategy

**Current Exemption (2024):**
- $13.61M per person
- $27.22M married (with portability)
- Sunsets to ~$7M in 2026 (indexed)

**Use-It-Or-Lose-It (2026):**
- Higher exemption expires Dec 31, 2025
- Additional ~$6.5M per person disappears
- No clawback if used before sunset
- **Action: Consider large gifts in 2024-2025**

**When to Use Lifetime Exemption:**
- Estate >$13.61M (will owe 40% tax)
- Sunset approaching (use extra before 2026)
- Highly appreciating assets (remove growth)
- Business interests (transfer early)
- Want to see heirs enjoy inheritance

**Gifting Strategies:**
- Outright gifts (simple but lose control)
- Irrevocable trusts (more control)
- Family Limited Partnership (valuation discount)
- Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT)
- Sales to Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT)

### 4. Timing of Wealth Transfer

**Gift During Life vs. Inheritance:**

**Advantages of Gifting Now:**
- See heirs enjoy/use money
- Remove appreciation from estate
- Help when needed most (home, business, children)
- Reduce estate tax exposure
- Teach financial responsibility while alive

**Advantages of Waiting:**
- Maintain control and flexibility
- Step-up in basis at death (no capital gains)
- Qualify for Medicaid if needed
- Ensure own financial security first
- Heirs more mature at later age

**Optimal Timing Strategy:**
```
Ages 60-70 (Early Retirement):
- Start annual exclusion gifts
- Gift depreciated assets
- Hold appreciated assets for step-up

Ages 70-80 (Mid Retirement):
- Continue annual gifts
- Consider larger gifts if estate >$13.61M
- Establish trusts if needed
- Gift business interests

Ages 80+ (Late Retirement):
- Aggressive gifting if estate large
- Consider irrevocable life insurance trust
- Hold highly appreciated assets
- QCD for charitable intent
```

### 5. Asset Selection for Gifting

**Best to Gift During Life:**
- Cash (simple, no tax issues)
- Depreciated stock (heir gets your low basis)
- Roth IRA (no step-up benefit, grows tax-free)
- Life insurance (remove from estate)
- Business interests (appreciation removal)

**Best to Keep Until Death:**
- Highly appreciated stock (step-up eliminates gain)
- Real estate (step-up eliminates depreciation recapture)
- Traditional IRA (no step-up anyway, but control RMDs)
- Primary residence (step-up + capital gains exclusion)

**Example:**
```
Stock bought for $10k, now worth $100k:

Gift now:
- Heir basis: $10k
- Heir sells: $90k capital gains tax (~$13.5k at 15%)

Wait for inheritance:
- Heir basis: $100k (step-up)
- Heir sells: $0 tax

Gift depreciated stock:
Stock bought for $100k, now worth $50k:
- Gift now, heir basis $100k (but FMV is $50k)
- Actually heir basis is $50k (lower of cost or FMV)
- Better: You sell (harvest loss), gift cash
```

### 6. Trusts for Wealth Transfer

**Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust (ILIT):**
- Owns life insurance policy
- Death benefit outside estate (no estate tax)
- Pays estate taxes for heirs
- Provides liquidity
- Crummey provisions for annual exclusion

**Dynasty Trust:**
- Multi-generational wealth transfer
- Assets grow outside estate forever
- Protected from creditors/divorce
- GST tax exemption applied
- Best states: SD, DE, NV (no rule against perpetuities)

**Qualified Personal Residence Trust (QPRT):**
- Transfer home to trust, retain use
- Removes home appreciation from estate
- Gift tax value discounted (retained interest)
- Must outlive trust term (10-15 years typical)
- Can pay rent to heirs after term

**Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT):**
- Transfer assets, receive annuity back
- Appreciation passes tax-free
- "Zeroed-out" GRAT (minimal gift tax)
- Great for appreciating assets
- Must outlive term (2-3 years typical)

**Spousal Lifetime Access Trust (SLAT):**
- Gift to irrevocable trust for spouse
- Removes from estate but spouse can access
- Use exemption before sunset
- Reciprocal trust doctrine risk (don't mirror)

### 7. Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) Tax Planning

**GST Tax Basics:**
- 40% tax on transfers to grandchildren
- Same exemption as estate tax ($13.61M)
- Skip children to benefit grandchildren
- Avoid double taxation

**Direct Skip Strategies:**
- Outright gifts to grandchildren
- Trusts for grandchildren
- 529 plans (not subject to GST)
- Direct tuition/medical payments (unlimited)

**Dynasty Trust Approach:**
- Apply GST exemption to trust
- Beneficiaries: children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren
- Grows outside estate for generations
- Protected from estate tax forever

**Annual Exclusion Gifts to Grandchildren:**
- $18,000/year per grandchild
- No GST tax if under annual exclusion
- Requires present interest (not future trust)
- OR use trust with Crummey powers

### 8. Family Business Transfer

**Succession Planning:**
- Start early (10+ years before exit)
- Identify successor (child, key employee, outside)
- Gradual transfer (minimize tax, test ability)
- Buy-sell agreement (valuation, funding)

**Transfer Techniques:**

**Installment Sale:**
- Sell business to child over time
- Freeze estate value
- Child builds equity gradually
- Interest rate requirements (AFR)

**Gift of Minority Interests:**
- Gift <50% interests annually
- Valuation discount (30-40%)
- $18k annual exclusion per child
- Remove future appreciation

**Family Limited Partnership (FLP):**
- Parents retain general partner (control)
- Gift limited partner interests
- 30-40% valuation discount
- Annual gifting of LP units

**Intentionally Defective Grantor Trust (IDGT):**
- Sell business to trust
- No capital gains (grantor trust)
- Removes appreciation from estate

### 9. Charitable Giving Strategies

**Donor-Advised Fund (DAF):**

- Grows tax-free
- Can involve children in giving

**Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT):**
- Contribute appreciated assets
- Receive income for life
- Remainder to charity at death
- Avoid capital gains tax
- Income tax deduction

**Charitable Lead Trust (CLT):**
- Charity receives income (10-20 years)
- Remainder to heirs at low gift tax value
- Reduce estate and gift taxes
- Good for appreciating assets

**Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD):**
- Age 70.5+, up to $105,000/year
- Direct from IRA to charity
- Satisfies RMD, not included in income
- Better than itemized deduction

### 10. Wealth Transfer to Minors

**Direct Gifts:**

- Child takes control at 18-21
- Lose control permanently
- Kiddie tax rules

**529 Plans:**
- Maintain control
- Tax-free growth for education
- Can change beneficiaries
- Front-load 5 years ($90k)

**Minor's Trust (2503(c)):**
- Can use annual exclusion
- Trust terminates at 21
- More control than UTMA
- Child must have withdrawal right

**Crummey Trust:**
- Beneficiary has withdrawal right (30-60 days)
- Qualifies for annual exclusion
- Typically lapses (stays in trust)
- Good for wealth transfer with control

### 11. Coordinating with Retirement Assets

**Traditional IRA:**
- No step-up in basis benefit
- Heirs pay income tax on distributions
- 10-year rule (must empty)
- Consider Roth conversion instead

**Roth IRA:**
- Best asset for heirs (tax-free)
- 10-year rule (but tax-free)
- No RMDs during your life
- Keep Roth for inheritance

**Beneficiary Designation Strategy:**
- Spouse: Primary (can roll over)
- Trust: For control/protection
- Charity: Avoids income tax entirely
- Youngest beneficiaries: More growth years
