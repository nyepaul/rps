# Investment Policy & Portfolio Management Skill

## Purpose
To establish a disciplined, evidence-based approach to investment selection, asset allocation, and ongoing portfolio management that aligns with the user's risk tolerance and timeline.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. The Investment Policy Statement (IPS)
**Why it matters:** An IPS serves as the business plan for your wealth. It removes emotion from decision-making during market volatility.

**Key Components:**
- **Objectives:** Growth, income, or capital preservation?
- **Constraints:** Liquidity needs, time horizon, taxes, legal.
- **Asset Allocation:** The specific split between stocks, bonds, alternatives, and cash.
- **Selection Criteria:** How specific funds/stocks are chosen (e.g., "Low-cost index funds preferred").
- **Review Schedule:** How often to rebalance and review performance.

### 2. Asset Allocation Strategy
**Strategic vs. Tactical:**
- *Strategic:* Setting long-term targets (e.g., 60/40) and sticking to them.
- *Tactical:* Making short-term adjustments based on market conditions (generally discouraged for long-term investors).

**Asset Location (Tax Efficiency):**
- **Taxable Accounts:** Municipal bonds, tax-efficient index funds (low turnover).
- **Tax-Deferred (IRA/401k):** Bond funds, REITs, high-turnover active funds (tax drag is shielded).
- **Tax-Free (Roth):** Highest growth assets (Small cap, Emerging markets) to maximize tax-free compounding.

### 3. Rebalancing Protocols
**Purpose:** To control risk, not necessarily to maximize returns. It forces you to "buy low, sell high."

**Methods:**
- **Time-based:** Rebalance annually or semi-annually.
- **Threshold-based:** Rebalance when an asset class drifts by >5% (e.g., 50% target hits 55%).
- **Contribution-based:** Use new contributions or withdrawals to bring balance back (most tax-efficient).

### 4. Instrument Selection
**Passive (Indexing) vs. Active:**
- **Core-Satellite Approach:** Use low-cost index funds for the "core" (80-90%) of the portfolio and active funds or individual stocks for "satellite" positions.
- **Expense Ratios:** Aim for a weighted average expense ratio <0.20%.

## Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Draft a written Investment Policy Statement (IPS).
- [ ] Review current asset allocation against the IPS targets.
- [ ] specific "Asset Location" review: Are bonds in IRAs and stocks in brokerage/Roth?
- [ ] Check weighted average expense ratio of the portfolio.
- [ ] Establish a specific rebalancing trigger (date or threshold).

## Common Pitfalls
- Chasing past performance (buying what just went up).
- Market timing (moving to cash during downturns).
- Over-concentration (too much in one stock or sector).
- Ignoring fees and taxes.
