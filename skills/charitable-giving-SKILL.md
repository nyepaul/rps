# Charitable Giving Skill

## Purpose
To maximize the philanthropic impact of your wealth while optimizing tax benefits, creating a legacy of giving.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Tax-Efficient Giving Vehicles
**Donor Advised Funds (DAF):**
- **How it works:** Contribute assets now, take immediate tax deduction, grant to charities over time.
- **Strategy:** "Bunching" contributions (e.g., 5 years of giving in one year) to exceed the Standard Deduction.

**Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCD):**
- **Age Requirement:** 70½+.
- **Mechanism:** Direct transfer from IRA to charity (up to $105k/year).
- **Benefit:** Satisfies RMD but *excludes* the amount from Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). Better than a deduction! lowers IRMAA impact.

**Charitable Remainder Trusts (CRT):**
- Income to you for life, remainder to charity.
- Avoids immediate capital gains tax on appreciated assets.

### 2. Asset Selection
**Cash is "expensive" to give:**
- Giving cash = simple deduction.
**Appreciated Stock is "cheap" to give:**
- Giving appreciated stock = simple deduction + *avoid capital gains tax*.
- **Rule:** Always give appreciated assets (held >1 year) to DAFs or charities.

### 3. Family Philanthropy
- Involving children/grandchildren in grant-making decisions.
- Using a Private Foundation (more complex/costly) vs. DAF (simple/private).

## Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Review taxable portfolio for highly appreciated low-basis stock to donate.
- [ ] Calculate if "bunching" deductions makes sense this year.
- [ ] Plan for QCDs once age 70½ (even before RMDs at 73).
- [ ] Update estate plan to consider "testamentary" charitable gifts (e.g., leave IRA to charity to avoid income tax for heirs).

## Common Pitfalls
- Donating cash instead of appreciated securities.
- Missing the QCD opportunity after age 70½.
- Setting up a Private Foundation when a DAF would suffice.
- Failing to get proper receipts/acknowledgments for gifts >$250.
