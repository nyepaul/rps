# College & Education Planning Skill

## Purpose
To navigate the complex landscape of higher education funding, financial aid, and tax strategies to minimize the net cost of college for children and grandchildren.

## Core Frameworks

### 1. Funding Vehicles
**529 Savings Plans:**
- **Pros:** Tax-free growth and withdrawals for qualified expenses; potential state tax deductions.
- **Cons:** Penalty (10% + tax) for non-qualified use (though SECURE 2.0 allows $35k rollover to Roth).
- **Strategy:** Front-load contributions (Superfunding: 5 years of gift tax exclusion at once).

**Coverdell ESAs:**
- Lower contribution limits ($2k/year) but greater investment flexibility.

**Taxable Brokerage:**
- Maximum flexibility but no tax shield. Good for "overfunding" risk.

**Roth IRA:**
- Contributions can be withdrawn penalty-free for education, but this consumes retirement space.

### 2. Financial Aid Optimization (FAFSA/CSS)
**Expected Family Contribution (EFC) / Student Aid Index (SAI):**
- **Parent Assets:** Assessed at ~5.64%.
- **Student Assets:** Assessed at ~20% (High impact!).
- **Strategy:** Spend down student assets (UTMA/UGMA) first or move to 529s.
- **Grandparent 529s:** Under new FAFSA rules, distributions from grandparent-owned 529s do not count as student income (huge win).

### 3. Tax Credits
**American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC):**
- Up to $2,500/year per student for first 4 years.
- Income limits apply (Phase out begins ~$160k married).

**Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC):**
- Up to $2,000/year per return (unlimited years).
- Cannot double-dip with AOTC.

### 4. Cash Flow Management
- **The "Gap":** Difference between Cost of Attendance and (Aid + Savings).
- **Current Income:** Cash flowing tuition to reduce loans.
- **Loans:** Federal Direct loans (student) vs. PLUS loans (parent). Prioritize subsidized student loans.

## Analysis Checklist
- [ ] Calculate "net price" for target colleges using online calculators.
- [ ] Review ownership of 529 plans (Parent vs. Grandparent).
- [ ] Evaluate "Superfunding" 529s for estate tax reduction.
- [ ] Strategize asset placement to minimize SAI (Student Aid Index).
- [ ] Plan for the AOTC tax credit eligibility.

## Common Pitfalls
- Over-saving in 529s (limiting flexibility).
- Missing financial aid deadlines.
- Dipping into retirement accounts (401k loans) to pay for college.
- Not coordinating distributions with tax credits (double-dipping error).
