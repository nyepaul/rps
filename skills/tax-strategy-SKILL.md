# Tax Strategy & Optimization Skill

## Purpose
Comprehensive tax planning for retirement, wealth transfer, and legacy planning including Roth conversions, RMD strategies, tax-efficient withdrawal sequencing, and gift tax planning.

## Core Framework

### 1. Federal Income Tax Brackets (2024)

**Married Filing Jointly:**
- 10%: $0 - $23,200
- 12%: $23,201 - $94,300
- 22%: $94,301 - $201,050
- 24%: $201,051 - $383,900
- 32%: $383,901 - $487,450
- 35%: $487,451 - $731,200
- 37%: $731,201+

**Standard Deduction (2024):**
- Married Filing Jointly: $29,200
- Additional $1,550 each if age 65+

**Capital Gains Rates (Long-term):**
- 0%: Taxable income <$94,050 (MFJ)
- 15%: $94,051 - $583,750
- 20%: $583,751+

**Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT):**
- 3.8% surtax on investment income
- Applies if MAGI >$250,000 (MFJ)

### 2. Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)

**Current Rules (SECURE 2.0):**
- RMD age: 73 (born 1951-1959)
- RMD age: 75 (born 1960+)
- Penalty: 25% of amount not withdrawn (reduced to 10% if corrected)
- Roth IRAs: No RMDs during owner's lifetime

**RMD Calculation:**
- Account balance (12/31 prior year) ÷ Life expectancy factor
- Use Uniform Lifetime Table (most common)
- Separate calculation for each IRA
- Can aggregate and withdraw from one

**Age-Based Life Expectancy Factors:**
- Age 73: 26.5 years
- Age 75: 24.6 years
- Age 80: 20.2 years
- Age 85: 16.0 years
- Age 90: 12.2 years

**RMD Optimization Strategies:**
1. Delay to April 1 following RMD age (but 2 RMDs that year)
2. Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) - $105,000 max
3. Roth conversions before RMDs start
4. Withdraw more than RMD in low tax years
5. Consider aggregating accounts for simplicity

**Inherited IRA RMDs (SECURE Act):**
- Spouse: Can treat as own IRA (best)
- Non-spouse: 10-year rule (empty by year 10)
- Exceptions: Minor children, disabled, chronically ill, <10 years younger
- Annual RMDs required if original owner had started

### 3. Roth Conversion Strategy

**Why Convert:**
- Tax-free growth forever
- No RMDs during your lifetime
- Tax-free inheritance for heirs
- Reduce future RMD amounts
- Lock in known tax rate
- Reduce Medicare IRMAA impact

**When to Convert:**
- Low income years (between retirement and SS)
- Low income years (between retirement and RMDs)
- Market downturns (convert more shares)
- Before tax rates increase
- Before ACA subsidies end (manage MAGI)

**How Much to Convert:**
- Fill current tax bracket (to top of 12%, 22%, 24%)
- Calculate breakeven (years until tax-free growth wins)
- Consider multi-year strategy
- Model impact on Social Security taxation
- Avoid IRMAA surcharges

**Conversion Tax Payment:**
- Pay from taxable account (not IRA - better outcome)
- Withhold from conversion if no other funds
- Plan for estimated taxes (avoid penalty)

**Roth Conversion Example:**
```
Traditional IRA: $500,000
Current income: $60,000 (retired, before SS)
Tax bracket: 12% (up to $94,300)
Available to convert: $34,300 to stay in 12% bracket
Tax cost: $34,300 × 12% = $4,116

Repeat annually until age 73 (RMDs start)
Total converted over 10 years: ~$340,000
Tax cost: ~$41,000
Benefit: $340k grows tax-free forever
```

**Roth Conversion Checklist:**
- [ ] Calculate current taxable income
- [ ] Determine target tax bracket
- [ ] Calculate conversion amount
- [ ] Estimate tax liability
- [ ] Source funds for tax payment
- [ ] Execute conversion before Dec 31
- [ ] Pay estimated taxes
- [ ] Track cost basis (form 8606)

### 4. Social Security Taxation

**Provisional Income Formula:**
```
Provisional Income = AGI + Tax-exempt interest + 50% of SS benefits
```

**Taxation Thresholds (MFJ):**
- <$32,000: 0% of SS taxable
- $32,000-$44,000: Up to 50% taxable
- >$44,000: Up to 85% taxable

**Optimization Strategies:**
1. Roth conversions before claiming SS (reduces AGI)
2. Delay SS to reduce withdrawal needs
3. Use capital gains (favorable rates, not in provisional income calculation)
4. Harvest losses to offset gains
5. Consider muni bonds (but counts in provisional income)

**Example:**
```
SS benefits: $50,000
IRA withdrawal: $60,000
Total income: $110,000
Provisional income: $60,000 + $25,000 = $85,000
SS taxable: 85% × $50,000 = $42,500
Total taxable income: $60,000 + $42,500 = $102,500
Effective tax rate on SS: ~30%+ (marginal)
```

### 5. Medicare IRMAA Surcharges

**Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount:**
- Affects Part B and Part D premiums
- Based on MAGI from 2 years prior
- Cliff effects (avoid by $1 if possible)

**2024 IRMAA Thresholds (MFJ):**
- <$206,000: Standard premium (~$174.70/month)
- $206,000-$258,000: +$69.90/month
- $258,000-$322,000: +$174.70/month
- $322,000-$386,000: +$279.50/month
- $386,000-$750,000: +$384.30/month
- >$750,000: +$419.30/month

**Total Annual Cost (per person):**
- Standard: ~$2,096
- Tier 1 (+$838): $2,934
- Tier 2 (+$2,096): $4,192
- Tier 3 (+$3,354): $5,450
- Tier 4 (+$4,612): $6,708
- Tier 5 (+$5,032): $7,128

**Avoidance Strategies:**
- Monitor MAGI 2 years ahead
- Roth conversions in low-income years
- Harvest losses to offset gains
- Delay income if near threshold
- Qualified Charitable Distribution (reduces MAGI)
- Appeal if life-changing event (death, divorce, retirement)

### 6. Tax-Efficient Withdrawal Sequencing

**Standard Sequence:**
1. RMDs (required)
2. Taxable accounts (flexibility)
3. Tax-deferred (Traditional IRA/401k)
4. Tax-free (Roth IRA - save for last)

**Strategic Exceptions:**

**Fill Lower Brackets:**
- Take IRA withdrawals to top of 12% bracket
- Even if not needed (Roth conversion)
- Especially before SS starts (lower provisional income)

**Capital Gains Harvesting:**
- Realize gains in 0% bracket (<$94,050 taxable income MFJ)
- Reset cost basis
- No tax cost

**QCD Strategy (Age 70.5+):**
- Donate up to $105,000 from IRA to charity
- Counts toward RMD
- Excluded from income (better than deduction)
- Reduces AGI, SS taxation, IRMAA

**Market-Dependent:**
- Sell taxable account if market down (tax-loss harvest)
- Use IRA if market up (preserve stepped-up basis)

### 7. Tax-Loss Harvesting

**How It Works:**
- Sell losing positions
- Realize capital loss
- Offset capital gains (unlimited)
- Offset ordinary income ($3,000/year)
- Carryforward excess losses

**Wash Sale Rule:**
- Cannot buy "substantially identical" security 30 days before/after
- Applies to IRA purchases too
- Use similar but different fund (S&P 500 ETF → Total Market ETF)

**Strategy:**
- Harvest losses annually (especially Dec)
- Maintain asset allocation with similar funds
- Bank losses for future gains
- Coordinate with Roth conversions (offset income)

### 8. Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCD)

**Eligibility:**
- Age 70.5+ (not 73 like RMDs)
- IRA only (not 401k unless rolled to IRA)
- Direct transfer to qualified charity
- Max $105,000/year per person ($210k married)

**Benefits:**
- Counts toward RMD
- Excluded from income (better than itemized deduction)
- No AGI impact (helps SS taxation, IRMAA, ACA)
- No need to itemize
- Can give more than standard deduction

**How to Execute:**
- Contact IRA custodian
- Direct distribution to charity
- Do NOT take distribution first
- Get receipt from charity
- Report on Form 1040 (line 4a = full, 4b = zero)

### 9. Estate and Gift Tax Planning

**Lifetime Exemption (2024):**
- $13.61M per person ($27.22M married)
- Unified with gift tax
- Portable to spouse (must elect)
- Sunsets to ~$7M in 2026 (inflation-adjusted)

**Annual Exclusion Gifts:**
- $18,000 per person per year (2024)
- $36,000 from married couple
- Unlimited recipients
- No gift tax return required
- Unlimited for education/medical (direct payment)

**Strategic Gifting:**
- Gift appreciated assets (heir gets your basis)
- Gift depreciated assets in will (heir gets FMV at death)
- Front-load 529 (5 years at once = $90k)
- Use exemption before 2026 sunset

**Step-Up in Basis:**
- Heirs get FMV at date of death
- Eliminates capital gains tax
- Keep highly appreciated assets until death
- Exception: community property (full step-up)

### 10. State Tax Considerations

**No Income Tax States:**
- Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wyoming
- Retirement relocation strategy
- Check domicile requirements

**State Estate Taxes (2024):**
- 12 states + DC
- Exemptions: $1M (OR, MA) to $13.61M (CT)
- Consider relocation if estate >state exemption

**State Treatment of Retirement Income:**
- Some exempt SS (37 states)
- Some exempt pension (depends on state)
- Some have retirement income exclusions
- Check before Roth conversions

### 11. Tax Planning Timeline

**January-March:**
- [ ] Estimate prior year taxes
- [ ] Make final IRA contribution (deadline April 15)
- [ ] Review prior year tax return

**April-June:**
- [ ] File tax return

### 12. Common Tax Mistakes to Avoid
