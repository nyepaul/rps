## LLM-Enhanced Functionality

When LLM API keys (Claude or Gemini) are configured, the application gains powerful AI-assisted features.

### 🤖 Enhanced with LLM APIs

#### 1. **AI Financial Advisor**

**Without LLM:** Not available - tab shows message to configure API keys

**With LLM:** Full conversational AI advisor capabilities

- **Natural language conversations** about your retirement plan
- **Personalized financial advice** based on your specific profile data
- **Complex question answering:**
  - "Should I retire at 60 or 65?"
  - "How much can I safely spend in retirement?"
  - "What's my optimal Social Security claiming strategy?"
  - "Should I do Roth conversions?"
  - "How should I adjust my asset allocation?"

- **Context-aware responses:**
  - AI has access to your complete profile data
  - Understands your assets, income, expenses
  - Considers your retirement timeline
  - Factors in your risk tolerance

- **Scenario exploration:**
  - "What if I sell my rental property?"
  - "How does early retirement affect my plan?"
  - "What happens if the market crashes?"

- **Conversation history:**
  - Multi-turn conversations
  - Follow-up questions understood
  - Previous context remembered within session

**Example Conversations:**

```
User: "Should I retire at 60 or wait until 65?"

AI (with your data): "Based on your current assets of $1.2M and
annual expenses of $75,000, retiring at 60 would reduce your
success probability from 94% to 78%. Here's why:

1. Social Security: Claiming at 60 means reduced benefits (about
   30% less than FRA)
2. Portfolio sustainability: 5 extra years of withdrawals with
   fewer years of growth
3. Healthcare: You'd need 5 years of coverage before Medicare

I'd recommend working 2 more years to 62, which improves your
success rate to 89% while still allowing earlier retirement..."
```

#### 2. **Automated Action Items**

**Without LLM:** Manual action item creation only

**With LLM:** AI-generated personalized action items

- **Automatic generation** based on your profile analysis
- **Prioritized recommendations** (high/medium/low)
- **Specific, actionable tasks:**
  - "Review 401(k) allocation - currently 90% stocks at age 55"
  - "Schedule Roth conversion consultation for 2024 tax planning"
  - "Increase emergency fund to 6 months expenses ($45,000)"
  - "Research Medicare supplement plans (3 years until eligibility)"

- **Due date suggestions** based on urgency
- **Rationale provided** for each recommendation
- **Update automatically** as your profile changes

#### 3. **AI-Powered Asset Extraction**

**Without LLM:** Manual asset entry only

**With LLM:** Upload screenshots/images for automatic data extraction

- **Image upload** of:
  - Brokerage statements
  - Bank account summaries
  - Property valuations
  - Investment account screenshots

- **Automatic extraction** of:
  - Account names
  - Account values
  - Asset types
  - Allocation information

- **Smart parsing:**
  - Recognizes different statement formats
  - Handles various financial institutions
  - Extracts relevant data accurately

- **Review before import:**

## LLM Configuration

### How to Configure LLM APIs

1. **Navigate to Settings** (top-right ⚙️ icon)
2. **Click "🔐 API Keys" tab**
3. **Enter your API key(s):**
   - **Claude:** Get from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - **Gemini:** Get from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

4. **Test connection** (optional but recommended)
5. **Save**

### Security

- **Encrypted storage:** All API keys encrypted with AES-256-GCM
- **Profile-specific:** Different profiles can use different API keys
- **User-specific:** Your keys never accessible to other users
- **No logging:** Keys never appear in logs or error messages

### Which LLM to Use?

**Claude (Anthropic):**
- Excellent reasoning capabilities
- Strong financial analysis
- Good at nuanced advice
- Longer context window
- Generally more expensive

**Gemini (Google):**
