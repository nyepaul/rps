# Dynamic Pension Modeling

The Retirement Planning System now supports fully adjustable pension values. You are no longer locked into a single "correct" number—you can model and compare different scenarios yourself.

## How to Adjust Your Pension

### 1. Modeling as Annual Income (Recommended Baseline)
This is the default for your **"Initial"** profile.
- **Location**: Go to **Profile & Data** -> **Income Streams**.
- **Current Value**: $120,000 / year.
- **Impact**: Provides a stable floor, covering ~40% of your $300k spending target.
- **Optimization**: You can toggle "Inflation Adjusted" to see the massive impact of COLA over 30 years.

### 2. Modeling as a Lump Sum
If you have the option to take a one-time payout:
- **Location**: Go to **Profile & Data** -> **Assets & Investments**.
- **Action**: Add a new item named "Pension Payout" with type **"Pension"** (which the system treats as a Traditional IRA/Pre-Tax asset).
- **Impact**: Increases your investable portfolio but removes the guaranteed floor.
- **Trade-off**: Increases "Sequence of Returns" risk in early retirement.
